This repository provides code for the Normalised Radon Transform Damage (NeRD) detection method.
The code in this repository accompanies the paper "Damage Detection on Antarctic Ice Shelves
using the Normalised Radon Transform" by M. Izeboud and S. Lhermitte, in review at Remote Sensing of Environment (2022).

NB: the repository is currently under development. Files will soon be added.
